"""
Theme palettes and stylesheet rendering.

Two full palettes (DARK_PALETTE / LIGHT_PALETTE) live here as plain
dicts - the single source of truth for every color in the app.
style.qss.template holds the actual QSS RULES (selectors, properties,
layout) with ${key} placeholders standing in for colors; this module
fills those in at load time.

To add a new themed color:
    1. Use ${your_key} somewhere in style.qss.template
    2. Add "your_key" to BOTH palettes below
Forgetting either one raises a clear KeyError at startup rather than
silently rendering something wrong - much safer than hand-maintaining
two separate .qss files that can quietly drift apart over time.
